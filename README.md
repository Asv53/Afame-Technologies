## TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

*The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank
after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone on board,
resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.*

1. Build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.
2. Dataset contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
